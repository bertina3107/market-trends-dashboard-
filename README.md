# Project Overview:
This dynamic Tableau dashboard for Business Trends and Market Initiatives enhances data visualization with advanced design and interactive features. It includes rounded corner containers for a modern UI, a gradient area chart with a toggle button to switch between price and volume, and time period filters to analyze data by this month, this year, or last year. The dashboard also features KPIs with responsive colors and directional arrows to display current metric values and Year-to-Date (YTD) changes. Additionally, it incorporates a partial donut chart for controlling visibility and gradient progress line charts with circle markers and conditional coloring to highlight key trends.
